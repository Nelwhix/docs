title: How Treblle works
description: Treblle works by providing an SDK for programming languages and frameworks that you can add as a middleware so for each requests to your API, Treblle collects information and send to your Treblle dashboard.

When you <a href="https://treblle.com/register" target="_blank">get started</a> with Treblle, you get a [Treblle Dashboard](/en/dashboard) and a ton of SDKs you can pick from to connect your API codebase to Treblle.

> You can check out the integration section of the docs to pick the language or framework your API is built on.

Once you've integrated a Treblle SDK in your codebase, this SDK will send requests and response data to your Treblle Dashboard.

In your Treblle Dashboard you get to see real-time requests to your API, auto-generated API docs, API analytics like how fast the response was for an endpoint, the load size of the response, etc.

Treblle also uses the requests sent to your Dashboard to calculate your [API score](/en/dashboard/api-score) which is a quality score that's calculated based on the performance, quality, and security best practices for your API.
