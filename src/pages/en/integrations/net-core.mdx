## Requirements

- .NET Core 3.0

## Installation

You can install Treblle .NET Core via NuGet Package Manager or by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package Treblle.Net.Core
```

## Configuring Treblle

You will need to add the required service by calling `AddTreblle` and providing your [API key](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard#accessing-your-api-key) and [Project ID](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard/projects#project-id).

Here's an example of configuring the Treblle services and fetching the configuration values from the application settings:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTreblle(
    builder.Configuration["Treblle:ApiKey"],
    builder.Configuration["Treblle:ProjectId"]);
```

Next you'll need to add the `TreblleMiddleware` by calling `UseTreblle` on the `WebApplication` instance.
You can optionally configure the use of the exception handler middleware.

```csharp
app.UseTreblle(useExceptionHandler: true);
```

## Using Treblle with Controllers

Now you can specify which endpoints you want Treblle to track by adding this simple attribute to any API controller or method:

```csharp
[Treblle]
```

## Using Treblle with Minimal APIs

To tell Treblle to track your Minimal API endpoints, you have to apply `UseTreblle` to your endpoint definition:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/", () => "Treblle is awesome")
    .UseTreblle();
```

That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project.

## Masking Additional Fields

If you want to expand the list of fields you want to hide, you can pass property names you want to hide as a CSV string to the `AddTreblle` call:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTreblle(
    builder.Configuration["Treblle:ApiKey"],
    builder.Configuration["Treblle:ProjectId"],
    "secretField,highlySensitiveField");
```

## Running Treblle only in production

If you want to run Treblle only in production, you can rely on the environment variables, or use a similar approach via your application config.

```csharp
if (app.Environment.IsProduction())
{
    app.UseTreblle();
}
```
