To integrate Treblle with [Express](https://expressjs.com), we provide an official SDK for Express - [`treblle-express`](https://github.com/Treblle/treblle-express).

## Installation

```sh
npm i @treblle/express --save
```

## Setting up credentials

`@treblle/express` expects your Treblle API key and project ID to be set as environment varible in a `.env` file or in your production environment.

Below are the environment variable that will be checked by `@treblle/express`

- `TREBLLE_API_KEY`
- `TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID`

## Setup middleware

`@treblle/express` expose a `treblle` function which returns a middlware, you can pass this function to `app.use()` to register it a middleware.

```js
const treblle = require('@treblle/express')
const app = express()

app.use(treblle())
```

Treblle will now now start monitoring requests on your Express server.

## Config options

You can optionally pass a config option to the `treblle` function.

```js
const treblle = require('@treblle/express')
const app = express()

app.use(
  treblle({
    apiKey: process.env.TREBLLE_API_KEY,
    projectId: process.env.TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID,
    additionalFieldsToMask: [],
  })
)
```

> The additionalFieldsToMask config option takes in an array of strings that matches properties in your response payload or header that you want to [mask](/en/security/masked-fields)
